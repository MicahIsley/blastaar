12/22 Patch Notes

-Added better save feature
-Clicking the scroll now lets you log in or create a new user, then you may load any previously saved files or make a new save. Also the game will autosave everytime you enter the title screen. The autosave only has the most recent save info on it.
- Loading a save will now correctly display all the cards you have earned. It does not currently save unspent gems, so craft all cards that you want before saving.
